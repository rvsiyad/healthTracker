## Next Steps for the Project

### Deploying Live Using AWS

Our next major milestone is to deploy the healthTracker application live, making it accessible to a wider audience. The plan includes:

- **AWS Deployment**: Utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) for robust, scalable cloud hosting. This will ensure high availability and performance of the healthTracker application.
- **Setting Up Domain**: The application will be accessible through the custom domain `www.RSFitness.com` or similar variations. This domain name aligns with our branding and makes it easy for users to remember and access our service.
- **Secure Connections**: Implementing SSL/TLS to ensure secure and encrypted connections to our web application.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Setting up the AWS environment to be scalable, handling increased traffic and usage seamlessly.

### Continuous Improvement and Updates

- **Regular Updates**: Continuously updating the application with new features, improvements, and security patches.
- **User Feedback**: Actively seeking and incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience.

### Expanding Features

- **Mobile App Development**: Exploring the possibility of developing a mobile version of RSFitness for iOS and Android to provide users with on-the-go access.

We are excited about these next steps and believe they will significantly enhance the value and reach of the healthTracker - RS Fitness application.
